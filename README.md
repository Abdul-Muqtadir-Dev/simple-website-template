## Getting Started

2. **Open the Template**: Locate the `index.html` file and open it in a web browser to preview the template.
3. **Edit the Files**: Use any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text) to modify the content and styles.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and styles.
- (No separate CSS file is included; styles are embedded in the HTML for simplicity.)

## Customization Instructions
### Changing Content
- Edit text in the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<li>` tags within the `index.html` file to update the header, main content, and navigation links.
- Example: Replace "Welcome to My Website" in the `<header>` with your own title.

### Changing Colors
- Open `index.html` and find the `<style>` section near the top.
- Modify the hex codes (e.g., `#333` for dark gray) to your preferred colors:
  - `header` background: Change `background-color: #333;`
  - Navigation background: Change `background-color: #f4f4f4;`
  - Link colors: Adjust `color: #333;` in `nav a`.

### Adding More Pages
- Copy `index.html`, rename it (e.g., `about.html`), and update the content as needed.
- Update the `<nav>` links to point to your new pages (e.g., change `href="#about"` to `href="about.html"`).

## Requirements
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to view the template.
